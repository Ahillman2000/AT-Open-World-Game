# AT-Open-World-Game

A system to stream an open world game level. The system loads and unloads sections of the world, scene objects and non-playable characters around the player to give the illusion of a living world.

To use this solution, the map needs to be generated from within the editor and the gameobjects within the scene need to be updated. Both of these tasks can be carried out within the editor hierarchy by clicking on the MeshGenerator object, accessing the mesh generator script and running the two functions within the component menu (you may need to do these functions twice for the system to work).
